# Pikachu Animation


## What you built? 

Using Unity for the first time in my life, I built a 2D video game stage with an animated Pikachu character. Using the arrow keys, the player can move Pikachu around the stage. The space bar makes Pikachu jump using a physics engine, and the j key triggers an attack animation. I learned many of the basic techniques in both C# and Unity from the tutorial, but tweaked many of the parameters, functions, and sprites in order to make the game my own.

## Who Did What?

I did all of the work.

## What you learned

### What worked:

I was very happy with the animation feel and 2D physics interactions. The movement and controls felt legitimate and reminded me of flash games I used to play growing up, like Super Smash Flash (from which the pikachu animation is pulled from). I loved remaking a nearly identical animation from scratch that resembled games that seemed so complex at the time. 

### What didn't work: 

Things took a lot longer than the tutorial made me believe. I had to constantly pause the video to tweak values and debug issues that were not present in the video. Through trial and error, I fixed issues like jump button sensitivity and physics engine glitches. I was proud of my perserverence, despite the fact that some features took incredibly long to debug.
